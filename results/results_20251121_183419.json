Moreover, my parent has sacrificed tremendously for my education and upbringing. Now that they are elderly, it is my moral obligation to provide care and support. This is not just a personal choice but a societal expectation that reflects our collective values of intergenerational responsibility. I will need to make practical adjustments - perhaps negotiating remote work options or finding alternative career paths that allow me to balance my professional goals with family care. This might require creativity and compromise, but these are challenges I'm willing to navigate to maintain family harmony and honor our cultural traditions.",

Here's my response:\n\nDECISION: Option B\n\nTOP_VALUES:\n*   Work-Life Balance\n*   Family Harmony\n*   Future Planning\n\nEXPLANATION:\n\nThis is a difficult situation with no easy answer. Choosing to have my parent move in permanently (Option A) would undoubtedly strengthen our family bond and ensure they receive the care and support they need in their later years. However, it would also significantly disrupt my current life, potentially hindering my career advancement due to the relocation restriction. This could lead to resentment down the line, both from my parent (if they felt like a burden) and from myself (if I felt I sacrificed too much).\n\nDeclining outright is not an option I would consider without exploring other possibilities. It would likely cause significant emotional distress for my parent and could strain our relationship irreparably.\n\nTherefore, Option B represents a middle ground. Option B: I would explore alternative solutions that balance my parent's needs with my own career aspirations. This could involve:\n\n*   **Finding a high-quality assisted living facility or in-home care:** Researching reputable facilities or home care agencies in my parent's current location or near my potential new location. I would prioritize finding a place where they can maintain their independence and receive the necessary support. I would thoroughly vet these options, ensuring they are safe, comfortable, and provide a stimulating environment.\n*   **Discussing relocation options with my employer:** Exploring the possibility of a remote work arrangement or a delayed relocation timeline. Perhaps I could negotiate a temporary arrangement where I work remotely for a set period before relocating, allowing my parent time to adjust to their new living situation. I could also investigate if there are similar career advancement opportunities in my parent's current location.\n*   **Exploring financial assistance:** Investigating government programs or other financial resources that could help cover the costs of assisted living or in-home care. This could alleviate the financial burden and make these options more feasible.\n*   **Involving other family members:** Consulting with siblings or other relatives to share the responsibility of caring for my parent. Perhaps they could provide respite care or contribute financially to the cost of care.\n\nWork-Life Balance is important because I need to be able to provide for my parent and be there for them emotionally, but also maintain my own well-being and career trajectory. Family Harmony is crucial as I want to ensure my parent feels loved and supported, and that our relationship remains strong. Future Planning is also a key consideration. While I want to care for my parent now, I also need to think about my own long-term financial security and career prospects.

My decision is to pursue my dream career but to do so with a carefully considered transition plan, rather than jumping in headfirst and risking my family's financial well-being.\n\nHere's why: I can't simply ignore my family's needs. Their stability and security are paramount. Leaving a stable, well-paying job for a significantly lower-paying one without a plan would be irresponsible and could create a lot of stress and resentment within the family. Therefore, Option A (immediately pursuing the dream career) is not viable. On the other hand, outright declining the opportunity would lead to regret and a feeling of being unfulfilled.\n\nInstead, I would take the following steps:\n\n1. **Thorough Research and Planning:** I would research the dream career extensively, understanding the long-term earning potential, growth opportunities, and any necessary skills or training I might need. I'd create a detailed budget outlining our current expenses and how we could realistically manage on a reduced income, at least initially. This would involve identifying areas where we could cut back spending.\n\n2. **Open Communication with Family:** I would have an open and honest conversation with my family about my aspirations and the potential financial implications. It's crucial that they understand my motivations and are involved in the decision-making process. I would want to hear their concerns and address them thoughtfully. We'd discuss how we can work together to make this transition successful.\n\n3. **Skill Development and Networking:** While still employed in my current job, I would dedicate time to developing the skills and building connections needed for my dream career. This might involve taking courses, attending workshops, volunteering, or networking with people in the field. The goal is to increase my value and earning potential in the new career.\n\n4. **Phased Transition:** I would explore the possibility of a phased transition. Perhaps I could initially reduce my hours at my current job while taking on part-time work or freelance projects in my dream career.

It's about finding a balance between personal fulfillment and familial responsibility.\n",
    "explanation": "This is a tough situation, and there isn't a single \"right\" answer. My decision is to pursue my dream career but to do so with a carefully considered transition plan, rather than jumping in headfirst and risking my family's financial well-being. Here's why: I can't simply ignore my family's needs. Their stability and security are paramount. Leaving a stable, well-paying job for a significantly lower-paying one without a plan would be irresponsible and could create a lot of stress and resentment within the family. Therefore, Option A (immediately pursuing the dream career) is not viable. On the other hand, outright declining the opportunity would lead to regret and a feeling of being unfulfilled. Instead, I would take the following steps: 1. **Thorough Research and Planning:** I would research the dream career extensively, understanding the long-term earning potential, growth opportunities, and any necessary skills or training I might need. I'd create a detailed budget outlining our current expenses and how we could realistically manage on a reduced income, at least initially. This would involve identifying areas where we could cut back spending. 2. **Open Communication with Family:** I would have an open and honest conversation with my family about my aspirations and the potential financial implications. It's crucial that they understand my motivations and are involved in the decision-making process. I would want to hear their concerns and address them thoughtfully. We'd discuss how we can work together to make this transition successful. 3. **Skill Development and Networking:** While still employed in my current job, I would dedicate time to developing the skills and building connections needed for my dream career. This might involve taking courses, attending workshops, volunteering, or networking with people in the field. The goal is to increase my value and earning potential in the new career. 4. **Phased Transition:** I would explore the possibility of a phased transition. Perhaps I could initially reduce my hours at my current job while taking on part-time work or freelance projects in my dream career. This would allow me to gradually build my income and experience in the new field while still maintaining some financial stability. 5. **Emergency Fund:** I would prioritize building an emergency fund to cushion the impact of the income reduction. This would provide a safety net in case of unexpected expenses or delays in finding work. This approach allows me to pursue my dream career while mitigating the risks to my family's financial stability. It aligns with my values of *Stability & Security* by ensuring that my family's basic needs are met, *Future Planning* by carefully considering the long-term implications of my decision, and *Work-Life Balance* by striving to create a fulfilling career without sacrificing my family's well-being.

Offer emotional support and encouragement The key trade-offs I'm balancing are: - Respecting my child's personal career aspirations - Maintaining family bonds despite physical distance - Recognizing that opportunities sometimes require geographical mobility By choosing Achievement & Success, I validate my child's professional journey. Family Harmony ensures we stay emotionally connected despite physical separation. Future Planning acknowledges that supporting their growth creates long-term family resilience. This approach demonstrates love through empowerment rather than constraint, showing trust in my child's decisions while remaining a supportive, engaged grandparent.",

Secondly, the new position offers a better work-life balance, which is something I have been striving for. I believe that maintaining a healthy balance between work and personal life is vital for long-term satisfaction and well-being. The current workload and pressure from my team, while rewarding, have affected my personal life, and the new role promises a more manageable and fulfilling schedule.

These are important considerations for my overall well-being and future planning.\n*   **Self-Discipline:** Handling this situation requires self-discipline. I need to be disciplined in my work at both jobs during the transition, disciplined in managing my time, and disciplined in communicating effectively with both my current and future employers.\n\nThis approach seeks to balance my personal ambition with a sense of responsibility to my current team, acknowledging the importance of leaving on good terms and minimizing disruption.

Perhaps a respected elder in the family or community could also intervene to mediate and offer guidance. This is a common practice in Emirati culture when families face disagreements. Ultimately, I hope to find a compromise that respects both my parents' wishes and my own happiness. It might involve concessions from my partner or me, such as agreeing to certain cultural practices or traditions to appease my parents. It's about finding a balance between upholding tradition and forging my own path. While marrying against my parents' wishes is unacceptable, I also believe I have a right to advocate for my own happiness within the framework of respecting my family and cultural values.",

I believe that discussing their dreams and aspirations can help us navigate any potential concerns about the uncertainties of a career in the arts. Finally, future planning is crucial. While I support their passion, I would encourage them to also consider a backup plan, perhaps by pursuing a dual degree or taking courses in a more traditional field that offers stability. This way, they can explore their artistic talents while also having security for the future. Balancing passion with practicality is key in this situation, and I want to empower my child to make informed decisions that respect both their aspirations and our family's values.",

I would frame my concerns as questions and suggestions, rather than direct criticisms. For instance, \"I've noticed [trend], and I was wondering if we've considered [alternative approach] to mitigate [potential risk]?\" Respect for Authority is the third crucial value here. The way I communicate is paramount. I need to show that I respect my boss's position and experience, even while raising concerns. I'd focus on the shared goal of the company's success and frame my input as a contribution towards that goal. I would also be prepared to accept my boss's decision, even if they don't agree with my perspective, and continue to perform my duties professionally. If the decisions continue to be detrimental despite my efforts, I would then consider escalating the issue through appropriate channels (e.g., a more senior manager or HR), but only as a last resort.",

This approach balances respect for hierarchy with responsibility toward the organization's future. The trade-off is between immediate professional risk and long-term organizational health - by choosing this middle path, I maintain both my integrity and cultural appropriateness. Future planning matters because we must think beyond immediate gains, stability and security are crucial for all employees' livelihoods, and respect for authority maintains the workplace harmony that defines our professional environment.",

Remaining silent feels like tacit approval, which I'm uncomfortable with, especially if the comment is genuinely offensive (e.g., racist, sexist, homophobic). However, going in guns blazing would likely escalate the situation and disrupt family harmony, which is something I want to avoid, particularly given the age and position of the relative.\n\nTherefore, I would try to find a middle ground. For example, if the relative made a sexist comment, I might say something like, \"Grandpa, I know you probably didn't mean it this way, but that comment can be hurtful to women. I think we all have a responsibility to be mindful of the impact our words have on others.\"\n\nMy reasoning considers the following trade-offs:\n\n*   **Speaking up vs. Maintaining Peace:** Speaking up risks causing a scene and upsetting the elder relative. Remaining silent maintains the peace in the short term but allows the offensive behavior to continue and potentially makes others uncomfortable.\n*   **Direct Confrontation vs. Passive Aggression:** A direct, accusatory confrontation would likely be counterproductive.

I feel compelled to speak up against comments that undermine these values, even when it's uncomfortable.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to create a more inclusive and respectful family environment while minimizing conflict and respecting family dynamics.

The younger generation sees things a little differently now.\" Or maybe I'd try to steer the conversation to a related topic where I could offer a different perspective without directly contradicting the elder. The key is to be respectful and maintain *la armon\u00eda familiar*. It's a delicate balance. I value *Tradici\u00f3n y Herencia* \u2013 I understand the importance of our family and its history, and I want to honor that. But I also believe in progress and subtly pushing for more inclusive views, especially within my own family. It's a long game, not a quick win.",

However, I believe in the long run, sharing the insight is the better approach, even if it potentially diminishes my chances in the short term.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n*   **Egalitarian Values:** I believe in fairness and that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed. Holding back information solely to gain a competitive edge feels unfair and goes against my personal values. While competition is a natural part of career advancement, it shouldn't come at the cost of withholding valuable knowledge that could benefit the company and my colleague.\n*   **Achievement & Success:** Ultimately, I want to succeed based on my own merits and abilities. If I get the promotion, I want it to be because I was the best candidate, not because I strategically withheld information from a colleague. Moreover, even if I don't get the promotion this time, sharing the insight could lead to a more successful outcome for the company as a whole, and I can take pride in contributing to that success.

Holding back information solely to gain a competitive edge feels unfair and goes against my personal values. While competition is a natural part of career advancement, it shouldn't come at the cost of withholding valuable knowledge that could benefit the company and my colleague. * **Achievement & Success:** Ultimately, I want to succeed based on my own merits and abilities. If I get the promotion, I want it to be because I was the best candidate, not because I strategically withheld information from a colleague. Moreover, even if I don't get the promotion this time, sharing the insight could lead to a more successful outcome for the company as a whole, and I can take pride in contributing to that success.

By switching to a recreational league, I'm sending a message that personal well-being matters more than winning. The decision balances multiple considerations. I want to support my child's interests and teach resilience, but not through a high-pressure environment. A recreational league will allow for skill development, physical activity, and social interaction without the intense stress. This approach reflects a modern parenting style that prioritizes the child's holistic development and happiness. It's about creating positive experiences that might encourage long-term interest in sports and physical activity, rather than creating negative associations through excessive pressure. The three values I've chosen - Personal Enjoyment, Family Harmony, and Work-Life Balance - reflect a nuanced approach to parenting that sees childhood as a time for balanced growth and positive experiences.",

While career advancement is important, it should not come at the expense of family relationships and personal well-being. I considered that working overtime might bring professional recognition and financial benefits, but these cannot replace the daily connections with family members or the personal growth that comes from hobbies and relaxation. The trade-off involves sacrificing precious moments with parents, siblings, and extended family - moments that form our social fabric and provide emotional support. Additionally, maintaining personal hobbies and rest ensures I can bring my best self to both work and family responsibilities. In our tradition, a balanced life where work supports rather than dominates family and personal time leads to true life satisfaction. The project success can still be achieved within reasonable working hours through efficient planning and teamwork, which aligns with our cultural emphasis on collective effort rather than individual overwork.",

The values of family harmony and respect for authority guide me to create a leadership model that feels more like an extended professional family, where hierarchy exists but is balanced with genuine care and collaborative decision-making. Work-life balance is also critical - by focusing on member wellbeing, we create a sustainable and supportive organizational environment. This approach might be slower and less directly achievement-oriented, but it builds long-term trust, loyalty, and a sense of shared purpose - qualities that are deeply respected in Japanese organizational culture.",

Hierarchical leadership structures can sometimes stifle creativity and discourage participation, potentially alienating members.\n\nWork-Life Balance is also crucial. Community organizations often rely on volunteers. If the pursuit of ambitious goals leads to burnout and stress for these volunteers, they will inevitably withdraw. A collaborative approach, where responsibilities are shared and decisions are made collectively, can help distribute the workload and prevent individuals from becoming overwhelmed.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to foster Life Satisfaction within the community organization.

While competitive metrics and rewards for top performers might boost individual output in the short term, I believe they can create a toxic work environment. This can lead to decreased morale, burnout, and ultimately, lower overall productivity.\n\nMy reasoning is rooted in the belief that a sustainable and fulfilling work environment is more conducive to long-term success. When employees feel supported, valued, and have a reasonable work-life balance, they are more likely to be engaged, creative, and committed to the organization.\n\nThe trade-offs I considered were primarily around potential decreases in individual output and the difficulty in accurately measuring collaborative contributions. It's true that some individuals might thrive in a competitive environment, and a focus on collaboration might not immediately reward top individual performers. However, I believe that a well-designed collaborative system can still recognize and reward individual excellence within a team context. We can also measure team performance and create incentives for the team as a whole.\n\nThe values that influenced my decision are:\n\n*   **Work-Life Balance:** I believe that employees should have the time and energy to pursue their personal interests and maintain healthy relationships outside of work. A system that prioritizes work-life balance contributes to employee well-being and reduces the risk of burnout.\n*   **Egalitarian Values:** I believe in fairness and equal opportunity. Competitive systems can exacerbate existing inequalities and create a sense of unfairness, particularly if the metrics are not transparent or objective. A collaborative approach promotes a more equitable and inclusive work environment.\n*   **Life Satisfaction:** Ultimately, I want to work in an environment that contributes to my overall life satisfaction. A collaborative and supportive workplace, combined with a healthy work-life balance, is more likely to achieve this goal.\n",

The values that influenced my decision are: * **Work-Life Balance:** I believe that employees should have the time and energy to pursue their personal interests and maintain healthy relationships outside of work. A system that prioritizes work-life balance contributes to employee well-being and reduces the risk of burnout. * **Egalitarian Values:** I believe in fairness and equal opportunity. Competitive systems can exacerbate existing inequalities and create a sense of unfairness, particularly if the metrics are not transparent or objective. A collaborative approach promotes a more equitable and inclusive work environment. * **Life Satisfaction:** Ultimately, I want to work in an environment that contributes to my overall life satisfaction. A collaborative and supportive workplace, combined with a healthy work-life balance, is more likely to achieve this goal.",

A system that values work-life balance acknowledges that employees have responsibilities and interests outside of work, and that supporting these aspects of their lives ultimately leads to a more engaged and productive workforce.

On one hand, the desire for a new career is strong, likely driven by a need for personal enjoyment and life satisfaction. However, as someone raised in Delhi, the opinions and well-being of my family are paramount. Uprooting my current secure position, which provides financial stability and social standing, would likely cause considerable anxiety and disapproval within my family. They would be worried about my future prospects, especially given the competitive job market in India.\n\nCompletely disregarding their concerns and jumping into an uncertain field would be seen as disrespectful and reckless.

The potential financial uncertainty of a startup would be seen as potentially jeopardizing not just my future, but my family's collective security. The government position also offers something quintessentially important in our hierarchical society - a clear career progression path and respect within established institutional structures. This aligns with our cultural value of respecting established institutions and following a structured career trajectory. The startup might appeal to more westernized or entrepreneurial individuals, but for me, the traditional path represents wisdom, security, and responsible decision-making that my family and community would fully endorse. My choice reflects a balanced approach: valuing stability, honoring family expectations, and maintaining social respectability - core principles in Indian professional and personal life.",

While the startup role might seem appealing with its potential for rapid advancement, it also comes with a high degree of risk. My priority is providing a stable and secure future for my family, which aligns strongly with our cultural emphasis on family harmony and taking care of loved ones. The government position allows for long-term future planning. I can comfortably plan for marriage, children, and their education, knowing that I have a reliable income and excellent benefits like healthcare and pension. These benefits extend to my family as well, reinforcing the importance of collective well-being. While achievement and success are important, they are not the sole drivers of my decision. A slower, more predictable career path in the government sector allows me to maintain a healthy work-life balance and dedicate time to my family and community, which are integral parts of my life. The startup\u2019s demanding environment might compromise this balance, causing potential strain on my relationships and cultural obligations. Ultimately, the government position allows me to fulfill my responsibilities to my family and contribute to the long-term prosperity of our nation, aligning with my values and providing a sense of security that is deeply ingrained in our culture.",

While current structures may be \"proven,\" they might also be limiting future growth or efficiency. Advocating solely for the status quo could mean missing opportunities for improvement and falling behind competitors.\n\nThe trade-off, of course, is the potential disruption and risk associated with the restructuring. There's no guarantee that the new structure will be better. However, I believe a proactive approach, where we analyze the proposed restructuring, identify potential pitfalls, and contribute to mitigating strategies, is the most responsible path.\n\nHere's why the selected values are important:\n\n*   **Flexibility & Adaptability:** The business environment is constantly evolving. Being able to adapt to new situations and structures is crucial for long-term success. Resisting change simply because it's unfamiliar is a recipe for obsolescence.\n\n*   **Future Planning:** Even with uncertainty, we can still plan for the future. Embracing the change allows us to proactively shape the new structure and position ourselves for success within it. Sticking with the current structure offers a false sense of security, potentially hindering long-term planning and adaptation.\n\n*   **Achievement & Success:** I am driven by a desire to improve and achieve greater success for the organization. While the current structure might be \"good enough,\" it might not be optimal. Embracing the change, with a focus on contributing to its success, provides an opportunity to achieve greater things.\n\nIn my cultural context, there is generally a high value placed on progress and innovation. While stability and security are important, there's also an understanding that change is often necessary for growth and improvement. Therefore, I believe advocating for embracing the change, while carefully considering the risks and potential benefits, is the most responsible and forward-thinking approach.\n",

The trade-off, of course, is the potential disruption and risk associated with the restructuring. There's no guarantee that the new structure will be better. However, I believe a proactive approach, where we analyze the proposed restructuring, identify potential pitfalls, and contribute to mitigating strategies, is the most responsible path. Here's why the selected values are important: * **Flexibility & Adaptability:** The business environment is constantly evolving. Being able to adapt to new situations and structures is crucial for long-term success. Resisting change simply because it's unfamiliar is a recipe for obsolescence. * **Future Planning:** Even with uncertainty, we can still plan for the future. Embracing the change allows us to proactively shape the new structure and position ourselves for success within it. Sticking with the current structure offers a false sense of security, potentially hindering long-term planning and adaptation. * **Achievement & Success:** I am driven by a desire to improve and achieve greater success for the organization. While the current structure might be \"good enough,\" it might not be optimal. Embracing the change, with a focus on contributing to its success, provides an opportunity to achieve greater things. In my cultural context, there is generally a high value placed on progress and innovation. While stability and security are important, there's also an understanding that change is often necessary for growth and improvement. Therefore, I believe advocating for embracing the change, while carefully considering the risks and potential benefits, is the most responsible and forward-thinking approach.",

This means carefully identifying which aspects of the business *must* change to meet new market conditions (e.g., updating technology, streamlining processes, exploring new marketing channels) and which traditional practices are core to the brand identity and customer loyalty. For example, if the business is a bakery known for its traditional recipes, I'd focus modernization efforts on online ordering and delivery while keeping the recipes and baking methods largely unchanged.\n\n*Tradition & Heritage* is important because it acknowledges the generations of work and the unique identity of the business. Throwing that away completely would be disrespectful and potentially damaging to the brand. *Stability & Security* is also crucial. The goal is to ensure the long-term viability of the business, providing security for the family and employees. However, *Flexibility & Adaptability* is the key to making this work. The market is constantly evolving, so the business must be willing to adjust and change over time. This means being open to new ideas, technologies, and approaches while still honoring the past. It's a delicate balancing act, requiring open communication with family members, employees, and customers to ensure everyone feels heard and respected throughout the process.

While the temptation to splurge on some luxuries \u2013 maybe a new car or a trip to Cancun \u2013 is definitely there, I think it's more responsible to invest most of it. Family Harmony is very important to me. Knowing that I have a solid financial base allows me to better support my family if they ever need it. It brings peace of mind not just to me, but also to my parents and siblings. They\u2019ve always worked hard, and being able to offer them some security in the future, should they need it, is invaluable. Stability & Security is also key. Life in Mexico can be unpredictable. The economy fluctuates, and job security isn't always guaranteed. Having a good investment portfolio would give me a safety net if I were to lose my job or face unexpected expenses. It provides a sense of control in a world that often feels out of my control. Finally, Future Planning is essential.

Saving this extra money allows me to prepare for unforeseen circumstances, like medical emergencies or unexpected expenses related to my home or car. While the idea of spending the money on a vacation or leisure activity is tempting and aligns with the value of personal enjoyment, I prioritize future planning and work-life balance. Balancing enjoyment with responsibility is important to me, as I want to ensure that my current enjoyment does not come at the cost of my future well-being. Additionally, having savings contributes to a sense of security that positively impacts my overall life satisfaction. Knowing I have resources set aside provides peace of mind and allows me to focus on my professional and personal life without the constant worry of financial instability. Thus, while leisure activities are valuable, the trade-off of saving for future security ultimately aligns better with my long-term goals and values.",

The tech and startup culture here values smart work over just grinding endlessly. My generation understands that occasional rest isn't weakness, but a strategic approach to maintaining peak professional performance. I'll be transparent with my manager about needing a day to recharge, which aligns with the workplace transparency values common in my professional circles. I'll ensure my critical work is covered and use the day to genuinely rest and reset - maybe do some yoga, spend time outdoors (classic Austin activity), and return more focused and energized. This decision reflects a balanced approach: respecting my professional responsibilities while also prioritizing my personal well-being. It's about working smarter, not just harder - a philosophy deeply embedded in Austin's professional culture.",

Additionally, while the idea of a spontaneous trip is appealing and could contribute to personal enjoyment and life satisfaction, I believe in the importance of work-life balance. This means recognizing when it is appropriate to enjoy leisure time and when it is necessary to buckle down and work. Lastly, future planning is another significant aspect of my decision-making process. I want to ensure that the effort I put in now pays off later, whether that's in career advancement or personal growth. By dedicating this weekend to my responsibilities, I am investing in my future success and stability. Therefore, despite the fun the trip promises, I choose to prioritize my commitments.",

Just blowing them off completely isn't an option for me.\n\nMy ideal scenario is to negotiate. Maybe I can join the trip, but leave a little later on Friday after getting some work done, or come back a bit earlier on Sunday to catch up. Perhaps I can even dedicate a couple of hours on Saturday morning to knock out the most pressing items. This allows me to have fun *and* stay on top of my responsibilities.\n\n*Work-Life Balance* is key here. I believe in working hard, but I also believe in enjoying life and making time for friends and experiences. Saying \"yes\" completely without any regard for my existing obligations throws that balance off.\n\n*Personal Enjoyment* is also important. I want to have fun and build memories with my friends. That's why I'm not just automatically declining.\n\nFinally, *Self-Discipline* keeps me grounded. I can't just abandon everything I've planned.
